# Salary & Population Data Analysis

This project is an exploratory and statistical analysis of salary data for data professionals across different countries, combined with global population and demographic data.

###  Objectives
- Understand salary distribution by **experience level**, **remote status**, **company size**, and **continent**
- Investigate correlation between **population growth rate** and **average salary**
- Perform **statistical testing** (ANOVA & Pearson correlation) to detect significant patterns


### Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy, Statsmodels)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub


###  Key Insights
- Significant salary differences were found across continents using ANOVA (p < 0.05)
- Salary is moderately correlated with population growth rate in some countries
- Remote work patterns vary widely based on company size and region

###  Files
- `data me.ipynb`: Full notebook with cleaning, analysis, visualizations, and statistical tests
- `ds_salaries_prep.csv`: Salary dataset
- `countries-table_prep.csv`: Country demographic dataset
- `salaries_cleaned.csv` and `population_cleaned.csv`: Cleaned outputs after preprocessing

### Statistical Methods
- **One-way ANOVA**: Salary differences by continent
- **Tukey HSD**: Post-hoc comparison of group means
- **Pearson Correlation**: Relationship between population growth and salary
